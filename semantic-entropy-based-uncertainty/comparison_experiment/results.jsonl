If you're making a single hexagon, you'll need to make two or more parallel lines. The more lines you make, the more hexagons you'll have.\n\nThe simplest way to make a single hexagon is to make two lines parallel to each other. The sides of the hexagon will form a parallelogram. You'll need to make five of these lines to form a hexagon.\n\nThe number of sides a parallelogram has depends on the length of the two parallel lines. In general, if the length of the two lines is equal to the width of the parallelogram, you have", "You can think of a hexagon as being an equilateral triangle with a hexagon inside it. However, there are many ways you can think of the number of sides. In fact, there are as many ways to think of the number of sides as there are ways to think of the number of sides of a triangle.\n\nThe most common way to think of the number of sides is that of a square.
